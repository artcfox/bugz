Background

The Uzebox is a retro-minimalist homebrew game console, created in
2008 by Alec Bourque. It is based on an AVR 8-bit general purpose
microcontroller made by Atmel. The microcontroller is overclocked to
run at 28.61818 MHz, and only has a total of 4 KB of RAM, and 64 KB of
program memory.

About Bugz

Bugz is an all-original 2D platformer, written specifically for the
Uzebox. It has 21 levels, and the object is to collect all the cookies
in each level without dying. If you can finish the level before the
time bonus reaches zero, you'll get a higher score. Killing the bugs
will also increase your score. Includes single player, and multiplayer
modes.

Play Bugz

If you don't have a Uzebox video game console, you can play it using
an online Uzebox emulator: https://artcfox.github.io/bugz/

Using a keyboard is preferred, but the touch controls should allow you
to at least preview the gameplay if you are on a mobile device. The
native desktop emulator supports USB SNES game controllers, or you can
build your own Uzebox game console: https://uzebox.org/
